## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cloud SQL Postgres instance with IAM database auth for session persistence via ADK `DatabaseSessionService`
- Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sidecar on Cloud Run and docker-compose for IAM-authenticated database connectivity

- `cloud_sql_instance_connection_name` Terraform output for local development Auth Proxy configuration
- `CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` environment variable for docker-compose Auth Proxy target
- `google_cloud_location` Terraform variable — decouples Vertex AI model endpoint routing from infrastructure region (#118)
- `SESSION_SERVICE_URI` and `MEMORY_SERVICE_URI` environment variables — separate session and memory service configuration (#116)
- `Gemini` model wrapper with retry options in `agent.py`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Replace Agent Engine session service with Cloud SQL Postgres (`SESSION_SERVICE_URI` now `postgresql+asyncpg://` instead of `agentengine://`)
- **BREAKING**: Rename GitHub Environment Variables: `GCP_PROJECT_ID` → `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCP_LOCATION` → `REGION`, `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` → `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
- **BREAKING**: Rename Terraform variable `location` → `region` across all modules
- **BREAKING**: Replace `AGENT_ENGINE` env var with `SESSION_SERVICE_URI` and `MEMORY_SERVICE_URI` (full URIs with protocol prefix)
- Rename `session_and_memory` reasoning engine to `memory_bank` (memory only, sessions moved to Cloud SQL)
- Rename agent.py constants to `ROOT_AGENT_*` prefix (`ROOT_AGENT_NAME`, `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL`, `ROOT_AGENT_DESCRIPTION`, `ROOT_AGENT_INSTRUCTION`)
- Add `roles/cloudsql.client` and `roles/cloudsql.instanceUser` to app service account
- Add `roles/cloudsql.admin` for WIF principal in bootstrap module
- Enable `sqladmin.googleapis.com` API in bootstrap module

### Removed
- `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` environment variable — model selection is now a module constant in `agent.py` (#114)
- `agent_engine_uri` property from `ServerEnv` — URI construction moved to Terraform
- `root_agent_model` Terraform variable and CI/CD mapping
- `data/` volume mount from docker-compose (unused)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Editable install build argument (`ARG editable=false`) in Dockerfile for Docker Compose file sync with auto-restart (~2-5s feedback vs 20-120s rebuild)
- Factory fixtures in conftest.py (`create_mock_*`) for flexible mock creation
- Promotion source outputs to bootstrap environments (dev/stage/prod)
- Cross-path file sync instructions in template-management guide
- `RET` ruff rule for consistent return statement style
- OpenTelemetry background task context propagation pattern in observability docs

### Changed
- Docker Compose watch uses `sync+restart` for source files instead of full rebuild
- Replace "hot reload" language with "file sync with auto-restart" across all documentation
- Refactor agent.py and prompt.py to use constants instead of wrapper functions
- Enforce strict mock fixture usage in tests (no direct mock class imports)
- Generalize coverage omit patterns in pyproject.toml for downstream portability
- Upgrade WIF role to `serviceUsageAdmin` for main module API enablement
- Upgrade main module providers (google 7.12.0 → 7.21.0, random 3.7.2 → 3.8.1)
- Update bootstrap docs with deployment branch and tag protection rules
- Update job summaries pattern and project structure descriptions

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `terraform/bootstrap/pre/` module creates GCS state buckets (one per environment) before bootstrap — supports incremental provisioning
- `terraform/main/services.tf` — consumer extension point for additional GCP API enablement; `time_sleep.service_enablement_propagation` (120s, `for_each` per service) guards against async backend initialization after API enablement
- `terraform/main/iam.tf` — consumer extension point for additional WIF principal IAM roles; `time_sleep.wif_iam_propagation` (120s, `for_each` per role) sequences role grants before dependent resource creation
- Bootstrap exports `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_PRINCIPAL_IDENTIFIER` as a GitHub Environment Variable, enabling `iam.tf` to bind additional roles to the WIF principal in CI/CD

### Changed
- Bootstrap environments now use GCS remote state with `bootstrap/` prefix; `terraform_state_bucket` is now a required input in all bootstrap roots
- `terraform/main/.terraform.lock.hcl` committed with multi-platform hashes (`linux_amd64`, `darwin_arm64`); locks provider versions for CI/CD stability

## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-26

### Changed
- CI/CD workflows now use image digest (instead of tag) for Cloud Run deployments to ensure every Docker rebuild triggers a new revision deployment, even when tags are reused (e.g., base image security updates, manual rebuilds)

### Added
- "Image Digest Deployment" section in CLAUDE.md explaining digest-based deployment rationale and workflow
- "Tracing Deployed Image to Git Commit" troubleshooting section in docs/cicd-setup.md with gcloud commands to lookup digest → tags → commit SHA

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-25

- Reorganized `.env.example` with purpose-based grouping (Required, GitHub CI/CD, Optional) and corrected variable names
- Bootstrap module now creates GCS bucket for main module's remote state and adds storage.objectUser role for state bucket access
- Main module now uses remote state in GCS (bucket created by bootstrap) with workspace isolation
- Cloud Run deployment now integrates with Vertex AI Reasoning Engine via `AGENT_ENGINE` environment variable

### Removed
- `docs/github-docker-setup.md` (replaced by comprehensive cicd-setup.md)
- `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml` (superseded by reusable workflow pattern)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (historical planning document, core implementation complete, architecture decisions preserved in terraform-infrastructure.md and cicd-setup.md)

### Fixed
- Documented IAM bucket access limitation in artifact storage bucket variable (project-level storage roles only work within same GCP project, cross-project access requires additional configuration)

- Required Terraform configuration entries in `.env.example` (AGENT_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER)

### Changed
- Init script now removes template author from pyproject.toml (developers no longer inherit template author info)
- Refactored GitHub info parsing to use tuples directly (removed dict conversion step)
- Made `github_owner` required in TemplateConfig (parsing is all-or-nothing)
- Improved agent directory discovery in server.py with file-based path resolution (using `.resolve()` for absolute paths and symlink resolution) and environment variable override
